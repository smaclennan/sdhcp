.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple, tiny DHCP client. It runs until it enters the "Bound"
state, then forks to the background and runs as a daemon to keep
the lease alive.

The
.Pa client-id
is a series of hex bytes. If you don't specify a
.Pa client-id
then it defaults to your hardware (MAC) address. The
.Pa client-id
is usually a DHCP Unqiue Identifier (DUID).
If you are connecting to an internet provider and your DHCP address
changes on every bind, you probably should set the
.Pa client-id.

I'm sure there are plenty. It only currently supports a small subset of
DHCP options, and has been untested on larger networks. It ignores most of
the DHCP options it understands.
